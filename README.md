# Pizza_Challenge

## Introduction
For the Maven Pizza Challenge, Iâ€™ll be playing the role of a BI Consultant hired by Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey. You've been hired to help the restaurant use data to improve operations



A year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

## Recommended Analysis

How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?

How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?

How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any seasonality in the sales?

Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?

## Analysis
The various analysis tasks are listed and explained in the SQL file.

#### Joining data
The original data is used to derive multiple datasets by joins and manipulations using SQL and Power Bi to find and graph related info to the business analysis
